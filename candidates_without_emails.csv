The ability to focus and perform during long procedures—sometimes lasting over 15 hours—has instilled in me a work ethic that I carry with me into any role. My decision to pivot to a business-focused career has been one of the best choices I’ve made. Entering a new field with so much to learn has been invigorating. In my role at the Department of State, I have had the chance to apply fresh perspectives from my health background, contributing innovative solutions to complex issues. Over time, I have taken on various projects and embraced opportunities to expand my knowledge, including coursework in project management, business analysis, SQL, and coding. These skills have deepened my understanding of business functionality and enhanced my ability to drive results. This transition has sparked a passion for continuous learning and professional development. I am eager to bring this enthusiasm, along with my diverse skill set and experience to my next position and I am confident that my background in both health and business, combined with my analytical mindset and drive, will enable me to contribute meaningfully to your team.

Working closely with the project manager to facilitate sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. Updating team members on project progress by hosting meetings and having discussions with them. Key Contributions: · Gathering business and functional requirements by conducting detailed interviews with business users, stakeholders, and Subject Matter Experts (SME’s). · Eliciting requirements by reviewing documents, interviewing key stakeholders, creating prototypes and wire frames. · Writing concise, complete, and testable requirements, creating a Business Requirement Documents (BRD), and a Functional Requirements Document (FRD). Current Project: Identity and Access Management (IAM) My team and I are currently working on an Identity and Access Management project which consists of hardware, software, and network components. We use these components to manage user identities. The environment we are working in includes identity providers that store user information and issue tokens for authentication. The project entails creating user accounts for insurance holders, setting access controls, and monitoring user activity. As a business analyst and team lead, I conduct one-on-one meetings/interviews with stakeholders with the goal of gathering all the information on their requirements and expectations for the project. After gathering this information, I discuss the important items with the product owner and customer. My team and I use waterfall methodology for this project, and tools like Jira and Trillo..

Project Worked on: Structured Query Language (SQL) While at TD Bank, I worked on a Bank Accounts Management System project. My team and I developed a bank account system that covered the basic functionality of a bank account management system. By doing this, our customers or users who had bank accounts with our company could withdraw money from their bank accounts as often as they desired. We ensured that there was a validation to allow only a particular amount of cash inflows at any time, as well as to allow withdrawals if a customer had sufficient funds in their account. We used agile methodology for this project. Another project I worked on while at TD Bank was one which involved an Inventory Control Management System. My team and I used SQL to develop a system which involved making decisions towards inventory planning and maintenance.
